    // https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a
    // However, it made several existing use cases such as development in cloud
    // environment or subdomains in development significantly more complicated:
    // https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2271
    // https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2233
    // While we're investigating better solutions, for now we will take a
    // compromise. Since our WDS configuration only serves files in the `public`
    // folder we won't consider accessing them a vulnerability. However, if you
    // use the `proxy` feature, it gets more dangerous because it can expose
    // remote code execution vulnerabilities in backends like Django and Rails.
    // So we will disable the host check normally, but enable it if you have
    // specified the `proxy` setting. Finally, we let you override it if you
    // really know what you're doing with a special environment variable.
    // Note: ["localhost", ".localhost"] will support subdomains - but we might
    // want to allow setting the allowedHosts manually for more complex setups

      // project directory is dangerous because we may expose sensitive files.
      // Instead, we establish a convention that only files in `public` directory
      // get served. Our build script will copy `public` into the `build` folder.
